        <!-- Description Text -->
        <p class="p-16 font-custom font-thin  text-sm md:text-lg text-gray-300">
            Heracles, also known as Hercules in Roman mythology, is a hero from Greek mythology, famous for his extraordinary strength and courage. He is the son of Zeus and Alcmene, a mortal woman. Hera, Zeus’s wife, despised him and subjected him to numerous hardships. Heracles’ legendary strength was not just a gift but the result of enduring relentless challenges and pushing beyond human limits. This spirit of resilience and unstoppable determination mirrors the core of Thryve—a brand built for those who refuse to settle and constantly strive for greatness. Just as Heracles conquered his trials with unmatched power and perseverance, Thryve empowers athletes and individuals to harness their inner strength, overcome obstacles, and achieve their highest potential. Through innovative performance supplements and gear, Thryve fuels the modern hero’s journey toward physical and mental excellence.
